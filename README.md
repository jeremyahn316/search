# search

This project was created as a part of CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence using Python.

In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. Built general search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, UCS, Greedy, and A* and apply them to Pacman scenarios.
